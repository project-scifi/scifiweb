                <p>The Scientific Coat Initiative for Future Innovators promotes students’ scientific passions for higher education, provides teachers the resources necessary for hands-on scientific instruction, encourages the growth of mentor-mentee relationships, and fosters a visible community supporting young scientists’ endeavors.</p>
                <p>We achieve these goals by partnering with corporate and academic sponsors who endorse the purchase of laboratory coats embroidered with the sponsors’ logos. We then distribute these coats to qualifying under-resourced schools, along with other materials intended to aid educators in taking on a hands-on approach to scientific instruction.</p>
                <p>Our motivation as a non-profit organization stems from our early exposure to science, which ultimately inspired us to pursue scientific educations and careers. Thus, our goal is to empower and inspire future generations of scientists by providing K-12 students the necessary tools to develop fundamental scientific reasoning, address societal problems, and further scientific instruction.</p>

                <h3>Sponsors</h3>
                <p>Sponsors support their communities by purchasing laboratory coats embroidered with their trademark logo, thus demonstrating their commitment to the scientists of the future.</p>
                <h3>Lab coats</h3>
                <p>Laboratory coats showcasing the sponsors’ logos provided by a single scholarship will impact numerous communities. Students will wear these coats as they actively apply the scientific method in their education.</p>
                <h3>Schools</h3>
                <p>Schools will receive enough coats to outfit one or more laboratory classrooms, in turn generating a sense of support from the scientific community. Schools will then use these coats along with other materials provided to teach science in an engaging, dynamic manner.</p>
                <h3>Students</h3>
                <p>Students, supported by the scientific community and outfitted with sponsored lab coats, will run exciting experiments that challenge them to think critically like scientists. We believe that these experiences will cultivate their interest in pursuing further scientific knowledge. Our hope is that these inspired students will go on to become future innovators and science advocates.</p>
